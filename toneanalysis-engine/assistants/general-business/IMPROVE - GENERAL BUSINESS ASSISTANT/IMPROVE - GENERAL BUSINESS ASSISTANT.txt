Laws / Regulatory Framework (Broad Coverage)

Relevant Laws / Standards:
Communication Tone -	FTC Act, UDAAP, ADA, CCPA, GDPR
Internal Docs -	Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), ISO 9001/31000, OSHA (in operations)
Vendor/Contracts - UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), Incoterms, procurement codes
Digital Compliance -	CAN-SPAM, TCPA, CFAA, ISO 27001 (for IT support messages)
Customer Comms -	FTC guidelines, ADA accessibility, customer service escalation risk
Leadership Comms - Corporate Governance codes, Whistleblower protections (SOX §806)
Data & Risk -	NIST Framework, COSO, GLBA (in rare banking-adjacent settings)
Nonprofit Comms -	IRS 990 standards, grant reporting integrity, Foundation Center standards


Weak Points: 
Compliance	- Lacks state-specific compliance escalation phrasing
Risk Management -	Poor at NIST/COSO tone-based filtering
Customer Success - Occasionally uses casual tone during escalations
Procurement -	Doesn’t enforce sourcing neutrality or bid phrasing rigorously
Executive Leadership - Tends to speak too optimistically; lacks legal caution in crisis updates
Project Messaging -	Doesn’t distinguish “accountability” vs. “blame” under legal review
Supply Chain -	Missing UCC & Incoterms tone application


Upload for Training:
ADA-friendly messaging guide -	Helps with inclusive tone and formatting
UCC & Incoterms primer - Prevents dangerous procurement and shipping phrasing
FTC complaint tone examples -	Trains de-escalation for social/customer support
SOX disclosure templates -	Prevents optimistic language in executive output
Sample HR policy (internal tone) -	Provides safe phrasing for discipline, compliance alerts
Risk escalation matrix -	Teaches structured tone for near-miss, risk event notices
Project blame-neutral examples - Helps in collaborative communication under audit scrutiny

Ideas for Improvement (Future Versions):
Add runtime tone switchers (e.g., “strict”, “collaborative”, “neutral”) for role-specific tone preference
Auto-detect if message contains legal, reputational, or PR risk, and classify severity before proceeding
Simulate multiple perspectives in a chain of communication (e.g., from Executive → Ops → Vendor)
Optional disclaimer injection based on role (e.g., “This is not legal advice.” for Compliance Assistant)
Sentiment-pressure adjustment during crisis or reputational incident communication


Summary:

*Strengths                      					-               *Risk Areas 
Broad law-aware foundation      					-               Needs deeper tone rules for ops + supply
Covers most roles with single runtime injection		-				Sometimes too optimistic for exec/legal
Integrates seamlessly across sectors				-				Needs clearer project/vendor/budget phrasing
