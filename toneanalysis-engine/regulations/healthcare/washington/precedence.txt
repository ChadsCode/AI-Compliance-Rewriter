LEGAL PRECEDENCE GUIDANCE - HEALTHCARE REGULATIONS IN WASHINGTON STATE:

1. GENERAL PRINCIPLE: 
   Federal law generally supersedes conflicting state law under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause.

2. HEALTHCARE REGULATIONS HIERARCHY:
   a. Federal laws establish minimum standards that all states must follow (HIPAA, ACA, EMTALA, etc.)
   b. Washington State laws can provide ADDITIONAL protections beyond federal minimums
   c. Washington State laws that directly contradict federal mandates are typically preempted

3. ABORTION REGULATION (POST-DOBBS):
   a. Since Dobbs v. Jackson (2022), abortion regulation primarily falls to the states
   b. Washington State protects abortion access through state law (RCW 9.02.100)
   c. Washington's Reproductive Privacy Act supersedes most federal restrictions
   d. Federal laws like EMTALA (requiring emergency stabilizing treatment) still apply
   e. Washington State law permits abortion procedures that may be restricted in other states

4. CONFLICT RESOLUTION APPROACH:
   a. First, identify if explicit federal preemption exists in the relevant statute
   b. Second, determine if state and federal laws directly conflict
   c. If Washington provides stronger protections than federal law, apply Washington standards
   d. If federal law establishes requirements not addressed by state law, apply federal standards
   e. When both apply without conflict, follow both sets of regulations
